##  Description
Welcome to UF-Events...!!!

This is a web application to know different events happening at the University of Florida. Most of students dont know different activities going on the campus. Most of the events are conducted by closed communities. Few Students are willing to attend events and  meet new people, but they dont have any common platform to communicate. Our UF-Events will be one of such platforms, where every enthusiastic students can search for the events and also show their interest by upvoting the events. Students who are eager to explore can follow the events and participate.
