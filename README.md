##  Description
Welcome to UF-Events...!!!

This is a web application to know different events happening in the University of Florida. Most of International Students dont know different activities going on the campus. Most of the events are conducted by closed communities. Few Students are willing to host events to meet new people, make them feel comfortable with American culture, but they dont have any common platform to communicate. Our UF-Events will be one of such platforms, where every enthusiastic students can host events, post them. International students who are eager to explore can follow the events and participate.
